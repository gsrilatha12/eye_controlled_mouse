# eye_controlled_mouse
This is a fun project where I control the mouse using just my eyes!  It uses my webcam to track eye movement and blinking. When I move my eyes, the mouse moves. When I blink, it clicks. Built using Python, with MediaPipe (for face and eye tracking), OpenCV (for camera input), and PyAutoGUI (for mouse control).  Itâ€™s like having a hands-free mouse
